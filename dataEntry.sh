# some notes regarding this section
# Need to figure out how to get the command out properly so that it will render
# all the quotes and double quotes are getting kind of messy
# I think I should test this with the actual, live command to see if it will work
# I don't want to waste time formating if it would not even go through due to command sub
# being all wonky
# So testing this out is tough going as I have not figured out how to get past passing these varialbes in the proper format so that
# sqlite3 will accept it; keep plugging away; I think i do have a fool proof plan to simply write everything out to a file and then at the end
# use the .import command it import the data from the file....
